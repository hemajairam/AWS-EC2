# AWS-EC2
deploying Jenkins on an EC2 instance
🚀 As part of my DevOps learning journey, under the guidance of Abhishek Veeramalla, I recently explored AWS EC2 and successfully deployed Jenkins on an EC2 instance!

AWS EC2 is a powerful service that allows us to create virtual machines without the hassle of maintaining physical servers. Instead of managing hardware, scaling issues, and security, we can easily spin up instances on the cloud.

🔹 Why EC2? Managing 100+ VMs manually is costly and complex. With AWS EC2, we can provision and manage instances efficiently using the cloud.

🔹 Types of EC2 Instances:
✅ General Purpose | ✅ Compute Optimized | ✅ Memory Optimized | ✅ Storage Optimized | ✅ Accelerated Computing

🔹 Hands-on Learning: I recently deployed Jenkins on an EC2 instance, where I:
✔️ Created & connected to an EC2 instance via SSH
✔️ Installed Java & Jenkins
✔️ Configured Jenkins and accessed it via http://public-ip:8080

💡 This practical experience helped me understand cloud infrastructure, automation, Excited to continue my DevOps journey! 🚀
